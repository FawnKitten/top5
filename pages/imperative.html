        <h1 id="title">Imperative programming</h1>
        <div id="content-text">
            <p>Imperative programming is the oldest style of
            programming, it consists of giving the computer step by step instructions,
            instead of telling the computer <em>what</em> to do (declarative
            programming), telling the computer <em>how to do it</em></p>
            <p>This style of programming is the oldest because when computer
            technology was first being invented by Alan Turing, there were no
            compilers/interpreters/assemblers, so they had to give instructions
            directly to the computer in binary form</p>
            <p>Although other styles emerged (Object Oriented, Functional,
            Data Oriented) this style is still commonly used, especially
            when programming embedded devices</p>
            <h3 class="list-title">Disadvantages</h3>
            <ul class="list-elements">
                <li><strong>this style is less maintainable
                </strong> because code is not very organized</li>
                <li><strong>this style is harder to debug
                </strong> because variables are always changing and</li>
